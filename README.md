This is a fork from **http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Network** which can be build as a static library for Atmel Studio 7.

Not all files are needed.

Just copy the following structure into a GCC Static Library project in AS7:

```
RF24Network.cpp
RF24Network.h
RF24Network_config.h
Sync.cpp
Sync.h
```

Only ATXMega256D3 is supported right now!

** For further information please see http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Network for all documentation**
